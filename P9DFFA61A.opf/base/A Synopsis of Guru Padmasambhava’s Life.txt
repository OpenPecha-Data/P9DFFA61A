A Synopsis of Guru Padmasambhava’s Life
by Alak Zenkar Pema Ngödrup Rolwe Dorje

emaho
Emaho!
gyukyen mi nga oma chen gyi tso
With neither cause nor condition you were magically born
pedong lé trung dzükyé pema jung
From a lotus flower on the Milky Lake in the South, Padmasambhava,
solwa deb so tsé di barché sol
I supplicate you! Pray remove my obstacles;
tu ru ka yi dé nam dul du lok
Obliterate invading forces;
ten dang dro la dekyi denpar dzö
And grant all favorable conditions for the comfort of beings and the teaching of Buddha.
chima zangdok palri podrang du
In the future may we all awaken as a single gathering
orgyen pejung nyi dang yermé du
In the Palace of the Glorious Copper-Coloured Mountain,
tsombu chik tu ngönpar sangye shok
Indivisible from you, the master of Uḍḍiyāna!
