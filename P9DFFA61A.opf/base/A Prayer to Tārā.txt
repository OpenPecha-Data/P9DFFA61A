A Prayer to Tārā
by Alak Zenkar Pema Ngödrup Rolwe Dorje

shvang a
Śvaṃ a.
gyulü dakpa rabjam shying
In the heart of the myriad pure realms of my pure illusory body
nying ü yu lo köpa né
Lies the Array of Turquoise Petals.
rigpa ku sum jetsünma
Here my awareness, embodiment of the three kāyas, appears as the Noble Lady Tārā
toktsok taré nyishu chik
And the collections of consciousness the Twenty-one Tārās.
dudral mepar solwa deb
Within the realization of our inseparability, I supplicate you!
zungdzin lé jung jikpa gyé
Protect me from the eight fears that arise from dualistic fixation upon subject and object,
kyob shik dödön lhündrub dzö
Grant the spontaneous fulfilment of wishes
tsokchen sa la lhün dzok shok
And accomplishment of the ground of great convention.

Maṅgalam. These are the words of Pema Ngödrup Rolwe Dorje.
